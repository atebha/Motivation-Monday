# Purpose

This project was made to help those working at any level of a business to align themselves with their ultimate goal and keep themselves motivated. Which utimatley helps a business suceed because the person is motivated for their base goal a natural alignment for the business 
occurs that maximizes productivity.

# Design

I designed this project to used the date time library to calculate service time, and take a few input variables by the user. Based on the service time in months a motivational message is provided. 

# Challenges

This project was interesting and challenging because I had to first create a starting point in time and then a end point in the future. I also had to create variable inputs for users and craft a generic but motivating enough message to be displayed from the for loop. 

# Roadmap

Eventually this can be refacotred to be more optimized and runa function instaed. This function calls another function or file that houses the motivational messages. Also when a user runs this script the message that runs based on thier inputs can be written to a txt file.
